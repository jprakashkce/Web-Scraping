# Web-Scraping

There are many jobs portals on the internet. One of them is id.indeed.com. A lot of information on job vacancies that are needed. 

So, this time I will scrape the data on the website id.indeed.com using Python Programming Language with packages Beautiful Soup 

and Selenium, most popular in web scraping.


Project SetUp :

  >>> Make a file web scraping script in the “index.py.” 
  
  >>> “Jobs.json” is the result of scraping that we get, so we write it in the form of a JSON file.
  
  >>> And the last “runpy.bat” has only one click to run the python web scraping program.
  
  
  
Output :
